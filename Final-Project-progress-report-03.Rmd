Progress Report 3
====================

For this progress report, I need the following in an .Rmd file:

1. Code that accesses a dataset that contains your dependent variable and most of your relevant independent variables. 
2. A univaraiate graphic describing the dependent variable.
3. Results of two different analyses that predict your dependent variable (conditional means and either regression or classification)
4. Two graphics that show the results of your analyses above. (e.g scatterplot, bar plot)
