Progress Report 2
====================

For this progress report, I need the following in an .Rmd file:

1. Code that accesses a dataset that contains your dependent variable. 
2. A univaraiate graphic describing the dependent variable.
3. The conditional mean of your dependent variable at levels of at least one independent variable.
4. A bivariate graphic that compares your dependent variable with at least one other independent variable.
